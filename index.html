		<h2>How did the past look like?</h2>
			<p> I did 4 years of high school in Zimbabwe at Riverton Academy, well known for its vigorous system of getting results out of its students. The school however lacked exposure to the rest of the world. No phones, laptops. Not even my mp3 player to pump beats on a calm Sunday. 
			<p>The lack of exposure however didn't stop my relative curiosity about business or the rest of the world. That's not to say i did not have any exposure. My father moved from country to country frequently and we followed him almost everywhere he went which only fueled my curiosity even more. 
			</p>
				<p>I wanted to explore, to experience the realities of the corporate world and enjoy a vibrant culture. Here we are now, living in the present and developing our own version of a brighter future. As the locals say, "c'est la vie!"</p>

	<!--third card here--->
	<h3>What does the future entail?</h3>
	<p>
		 With sights set upon bringing long term transformational change in Africa and the world over, the goals are set. A strategy is in place and the tactics are promptly coming to full implementation.
